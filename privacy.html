    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information
        where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal

        information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
      </li>
    </ul>

    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong
        >If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      We may process your information if you have given us specific permission
      (i.e. express consent) to use your personal information for a specific
      purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e.
      implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click&nbsp;<a

    </p>
    <p>
      In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable
      law to process your information without your consent, including, for
      example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent
        cannot be obtained in a timely way
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>

    <ul>
      <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with

        may be victim of financial abuse
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would
        compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the
        collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach
        of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>

    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment,
        business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the
        purposes for which the information was produced
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary
        purposes

      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>In Short:</strong>&nbsp;We may share information in specific
      situations described in this section and/or with the following third
      parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may need to share your personal information in the following
      situations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your
        information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger,

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Business Partners.</strong> We may share your information with
        our business partners to offer you certain products, services, or
        promotions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
    <p>
      <strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong>We keep your information for as long as
      necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless
      otherwise required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
      for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention
      period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other
      legal requirements).
    </p>
    <p>
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
      information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if
      this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
      been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
      information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
      possible.
    </p>
    <p><strong>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></p>
    <p>
      <strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong>We aim to protect your personal
      information through a system of organisational and technical security
      measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
      organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any
      personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
      efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
      Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
      secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or
      other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security
      and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
      Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
      transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your
      own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.
    </p>
    <p><strong>7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</strong></p>
    <p>
      <strong>In Short:</strong>&nbsp;We do not knowingly collect data from or
      market to children under 18 years of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years
      of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or
      that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such
      minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal
      information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we
      will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
      delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may
      have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
      info@sensualweek.com.
    </p>
    <p><strong>8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></p>
    <p>
      <strong>In Short:</strong>&nbsp;In some regions, such as the European
      Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, you have rights that

      request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your
      personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In
      certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the
      processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by

      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your
      consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or
      implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to
      withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any
      time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section
      '<a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>' below.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
      processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it
      affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance
      on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</strong

      account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing
      purposes.

    <p><strong>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
    <p>
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
      applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can
      activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
      online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
      uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals
      has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
      signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice
      not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
      that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice
      in a revised version of this privacy notice.
